## Ticket Lifecycle Stages

- **Intake**: The stage where tickets are received through various channels such as email, web forms, or APIs. Each ticket is logged, assigned a unique identifier, and an initial status of "Open".
- **Assignment and Communication**: Tickets are assigned to the appropriate support staff based on predefined rules or manually by an administrator. Initial communication often involves an automated response to the user, acknowledging receipt of the ticket.
- **Working the Issue**: Support staff address the issue, updating the ticket with progress notes, status changes, and may request more information from the user.
- **Resolution**: The resolution stage is marked by resolving the issue, updating the ticket status to "Resolved", and informing the user. The ticket can be reopened if the solution is not satisfactory.
